# technology

Built using the Deno Fresh framework (https://fresh.deno.dev/), which utilizes the Preact library (https://preactjs.com/). Audio processing is done using WASM (Rust).

I am currently looking for roles in full-stack development, from contract work to full-time positions â€” and can be reached via [email](mailto:george@silentsummit.co).
